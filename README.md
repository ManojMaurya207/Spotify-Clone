# ðŸŽµSpotify Clone - Doubly Linked List Data Structure Implementation

This repository contains a simplified implementation of a Spotify clone that showcases the use of a doubly linked list data structure for managing song playlists.

## Overview

In this project, we simulate a basic version of Spotify where users can create playlists, add songs to them, and manage songs using a doubly linked list for efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.

## Features

- **Create Playlists**: Users can create new playlists with unique names.
- **Add Songs**: Users can add songs to any playlist.
- **Play Songs**: Songs are played in the order they were added to the playlist, utilizing doubly linked list operations.
- **Remove Songs**: Users can remove songs from the current playlist.
- **Display Current Playlist**: Shows the current playlist and the order of songs.

## Implementation Details

### Doubly Linked List Data Structure

A doubly linked list is used to manage the playlist:
- **Insert**: Adds a song to the end or at a specific position in the playlist.
- **Delete**: Removes a song from the playlist.
- **Traversal**: Allows traversal of the playlist in both forward and backward directions.

### File Structure

- `Spotify.py`: Contains the main program logic.
- `doubly_linked_list.py`: Implements the doubly linked list data structure.
- `playlist.py`: Manages playlists and interacts with the doubly linked list.
- `README.md`: You are reading it!

## Usage

To use this Spotify clone:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ManojMaurya207/Spotify-clone.git`
2. Navigate into the directory: `cd spotify-clone`
3. Run `python Spotify.py` to start the application.
